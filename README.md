# NECPU-Assembler

## Assembler

### How-To

- Command line usage:
  - `NEASM.py [-v/-b] [source_dir] <[targer_dir]>`
  - -v: full Verilog module output
  - -b: bin output (not yet implemented)
- Empty lines are allowed
- immediate must be a valid Python integer literal or expression. Note that immediate must not contain any white space characters even if you put an expression!
- immediate will be ealuated with `eval()` without safety checking of any sort, so please don't write anything weird here :>
  - One trick is to write `LINE_NUMBER` at immediate field to get the current line number~
- Comments (starting with '`//`') can be put on an empty line or after a valid instruction
- Don't use register 31 because it is reserved for the assembler for pseudo-instructions!

### Architecture Description

The **NECPU** is a 32-bit general purpose register architecture processor with the specifications below. Registers `$rs`, `$rt`, and `$rd` are placeholders for actual general purpose registers `$0`, `$1`, `$2`, ..., `$31`, each holding a 32-bit value. `immediate` refers to an immediate value (constant) and `label` refers to label in the instruction corresponding to a specific line in the code. All *immediates* are given as 16-bit unsigned values. Whenever an *immediate* is used as an operand with a register as the other operand, the *immediate* is zero-extended to 32-bit before computation. All *labels* will be converted into actual addresses using direct addressing mode.

**NECPU** can accomodate up to 4294967296 (2^32) addressable memory where each memory location holds 4 bytes (32 bits). **NECPU** is word (4 bytes) addressable. (It is not byte addressable!)

Every instruction of **NECPU** takes exactly one clock cycle to complete. Hence, the time taken of a code snippet can easily be calculated.

#### Instruction Set

We will use the following convension to simplify our description:

- Given a register `$r`, the content of the register `$r` is given as `R[$r]`.
- Given a memory location `addr`, the content at the memory location `addr` is `M[addr]`.
- `PC` is the program counter which is a special register that holds the address of the instruction currently being executed.

#### Instruction Encoding

![Instruction Encoding](https://github.com/lirc572/NECPU/raw/master/necpu_encoding.png "Instruction Encoding")

- Type A
  - SLT
  - SEQ
  - ADD
  - SUB
  - SLL
  - SRL
  - AND
  - OR
  - INV (`$rt` ignored)
  - XOR
- Type B
  - LW
  - SW
  - LLI (`$rs` ignored)
  - LUI (`$rs` ignored)
  - BEQ (`$rs` ignored)
  - BNE (`$rs` ignored)
  - ADDi
  - SUBi
  - ANDi
  - ORi
  - XORi
  - JMP (can also put under type A since only `$rd` is used)

Note that the `BEQ` and `BNE` instructions of **NECPU** differ from those of **MIPS**:

- **NECPU**'s `BEQ` and `BNE` instructions compare a register's value with an `immediate`, while **MIPS** compares the values of two registers.
- **NECPU**'s `BEQ` and `BNE` instructions can only skip the next **one** instruction if the condition is satisfied.

### Pseudo-Instructions

- **JUMP** (unstable)
  - `JUMP [label]`
  - `JUMP` instruction complements the native `JMP` instruction by accepting a label instead of a raw memory address. It simplifies the programming experience.
  - To create a label, put `[label]:` before the instruction you want to jump to. The label can be any valid string.
  - **JUMP pseudo-instruction now supports jumping forward and backward!**
  - A `JUMP` pseudo-instruction is translated to the following 3 instructions:
    - `LUI $31 [Upper half of label's address]`
    - `LLI $31 [Lower half of label's address]`
    - `JMP $31`
  - Note that when a `JUMP` pseudo-instruction is placed right after a branch instruction, the first two LI instructions will be put before the branch instruction so that the branch instruction can choose whether to skip the `JMP` instruction or not.
- **LWI** - Load Word Immediate
  - `LWI $rd, immediate`
  - `LWI` basically combines `LLI` and `LUI`
  - `immediate` here is a 32-bit constant value (zero-extended)

### To-Do

- Implement `.data` directive to support preloading data into the ROM.
  - Support loading external files into ROM (in the format of bin or bmp)
- **LA** (Load Address) pseudo-instruction to load the address of variable defined in the `.data` section

## Disassembler

*The disassembler is for the purpose of debugging only.*

### How-To

- Command line usage:
  - `NEDISASM.py [verilog_instruction_rom_file_dir]`
  - The disassembled file `disasmout.asm` will be created in the current directory
